# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview
### Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, theyâ€™ve asked you to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

### The data will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output we will use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, we will use a clustering algorithm.
